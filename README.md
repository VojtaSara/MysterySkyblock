# Mystery skyblock

Plugin for Minecraft Spigot introducing a new game mode - Mystery Skyblock. In this mode, your goal is to sell items for money and use the money to place mystery blocks under your feet. It requires extensive Minecraft knowledge to succeed, but as a reward gives you a much more interesting set of options compared to vanilla Skyblock. Play with your friends or alone.

## Playthrough

On first start, you have 100 points. You can spend these to place random blocks under your feet. To regain points, sell items in your hand by writing "sell" in the chat.

Be careful where you step and carefully manage the blocks you place - if you place blocks recklessly it's possible to run out and lose entirely!

## Mode selection
If you want to change modes (block palettes), simply write "list modes" and then use "select x" to choose the mode. Command "list materials" tells you what materials are included in the current mode.

## Installation

Create a directory with a Spigot server. For the world, an empty world is the best, but it is up to you. Once you put chosen world to the world folder, add the "MysterySkyblock.jar" file into the plugins folder and you are set! If you want to define what blocks you want to include in the mystery generation, add files to a folder called /modes/ in your server root directory and add files with block lists. Premade block lists are included in the folder /modes/ in this repository.
